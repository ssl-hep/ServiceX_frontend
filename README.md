## Introduction

Given you have a selection string, this library will manage submitting it to a ServiceX instance and retrieving the data locally for you.
The selection string is often generated by another front-end library, for example:

- func_adl.xAOD (for ATLAS xAOD's)
- func_adl.XXX (for flat ntuples)
- xxx for columns

These libraries are just coming up now, so this list is just an outline.

## Prerequisites

Before you install this library you'll need:

- An environment based on python 3.7 or later
- A ServiceX end-point. For example, `http://localhost:5000/servicex`.

## Usage

The following lines will return a `pandas.DataFrame` containing all the jet pT's from an ATLAS xAOD file containing Z->ee Monte Carlo:

```python
    import servicex
    query = "(call ResultTTree (call Select (call SelectMany (call EventDataset (list 'localds:bogus')) (lambda (list e) (call (attr e 'Jets') 'AntiKt4EMTopoJets'))) (lambda (list j) (/ (call (attr j 'pt')) 1000.0))) (list 'JetPt') 'analysis' 'junk.root')"
    dataset = "mc15_13TeV:mc15_13TeV.361106.PowhegPythia8EvtGen_AZNLOCTEQ6L1_Zee.merge.DAOD_STDM3.e3601_s2576_s2132_r6630_r6264_p2363_tid05630052_00"
    r = servicex.get_data(query , dataset, servicex_endpoint=endpoint)
    print(r)
```

And the output in a terminal window from running the above script (takes about 1-2 minutes to complete):

```bash
python scripts\run_test.py http://localhost:5000/servicex
            JetPt
entry
0       38.065707
1       31.967096
2        7.881337
3        6.669581
4        5.624053
...           ...
710183  42.926141
710184  30.815709
710185   6.348002
710186   5.472711
710187   5.212714

[11355980 rows x 1 columns]
```

If your query is badly formed or there is an other problem with the backend, an exception will be thrown.

If you'd like to be able to submit multiple queries and have them run on the ServiceX back end in parallel, it may be best to use the `asyncio` interface, which has the identical signature, but is called `get_data_async`.

For documentation of `get_data` and `get_data_async` see the `servicex.py` source file.

## Features

Implemented:

- Accepts a `qastle` formatted query
- Exceptions are used to report back errors of all sorts from the service to the user's code.
- Data is return in the following forms:
  - `pandas.DataFrame` an in process DataFrame of all the data requested
  - `awkward` an in process `JaggedArray` or dictionary of `JaggedArray`s
  - A list of root files that can be opened with `uproot` and used as desired.
  - Not all output formats are compatible with all transformations.
- Complete returned data must fit in the process' memory
- Run in an async or a non-async environment and non-async methods will accommodate automatically (including `jupyter` notebooks).
- Support up to 100 simultaneous queries from a laptop-like front end without overwhelming the local machine (hopefully ServiceX will be overwhelmed!)
- Start downloading files as soon as they are ready (before ServiceX is done with the complete transform).

Comming:

- Make it easy to submit the same query for 100 different datasets

## Testing

This code has been tested in several environments:

- Windows, Linux, MacOS
- Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
- Jupyter Notebooks (not automated), regular python command-line invoked source files

## Development

For any changes please feel free to submit pull requests!

To do development please setup your environment with the following steps:

1. A python 3.7 development environment
1. Pull down this package, XX
1. `python -m pip install -e .[test]`
1. Run the tests to make sure everything is good: `pytest`.

Then add tests as you develop. When you are done, submit a pull request with any required changes to the documentation and the online tests will run.
