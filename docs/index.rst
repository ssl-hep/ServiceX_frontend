ServiceX
================

The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) faces enormous computational challenges in the
2020s. The HL-LHC will produce exabytes of data each year, with increasingly complex event
structure due to high pileup conditions. The ATLAS and CMS experiments will record ~ 10 times as
much data from ~ 100 times as many collisions as were used to discover the Higgs boson.

ServiceX is a scalable data extraction, transformation and delivery system deployed in a Kubernetes cluster
designed to efficiently extract columnar data from large datasets.

Concepts
--------
This section describes the concepts that are important to understand when working with ServiceX.

Datasets
^^^^^^^^^
Datasets are groups of experimental data from which columnar data can be extracted. ServiceX
supports four sources of data:

1. Rucio
2. CERN Open Data Portal
3. List of File accessible via HTTP or XRootD
4. EOS Directory

Queries
^^^^^^^
Queries are used to extract data from a dataset. They specify the columns to extract, the events to
include in the output. There are several types of queries supported by ServiceX:

1. func-adl
2. Python Function
3. Dictionary of uproot selections

Sample
^^^^^^
A sample is a request to extract columnar data from a specified dataset, using a specific
query. It results in a set of output files containing the requested data that can be used
in an analysis via `awkward`, `RDF`, etc..

Transformation Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Multiple samples can be submitted to ServiceX at the same time. Each sample is processed
independently, and the results can be retrieved as files downloaded to a local directory or
directly accessed via a URL from ServiceX's output cache.

Local Cache
^^^^^^^^^^^
ServiceX maintains a local cache of the performed queries and their results. This cache can be used to avoid
re-running queries that have already been executed.
