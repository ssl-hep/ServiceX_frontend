Transformation Request
======================

Specify a Request
-----------------
Transform requests are specified with one or more Sample specifications, and
optionally a General section and one or more definitions which are substituted
into the Sample specifications.

These requests can be defined as:

1. A YAML file
2. A Python dictionary
3. Typed python objects

Regardless of how the request is specified, the request is submitted to ServiceX using the
``deliver`` function, which returns either a list of URLs or a list of local file paths for
each requested sample.


The Sample Sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each Sample section represents a single query to be executed. It includes the following fields:

* ``Name``: A title for this sample (this is arbitrary and chosen by the user).
* ``Dataset``: Rucio dataset, OpenData reference, or a list of files via XRootD.
* ``Query``: The query to be executed. This can be a FuncADL query, a Python function, or a dictionary of uproot selections.
* (Optional) ``NFiles``:  Limit on the number of files to process.
* (Optional) ``IgnoreLocalCache``: If set to true, don't use a local cache for this sample and always submit to ServiceX.

The General Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The General section of the request includes the following fields:

* (Optional) ``OutputFormat``: Can be ``root-ttree`` (default) or ``parquet`` (you can also use the enums ``servicex.OutputFormat.root_ttree`` and ``servicex.OutputFormat.parquet``)
* (Optional) ``Delivery``: Can be ``LocalCache`` (default) to download the results to the system on which you are running the client, or ``URLs`` to provide HTTPS URLs to the output on the ServiceX storage (you can also use the enums ``servicex.Delivery.LocalCache`` and ``servicex.Delivery.URLs``). The output files on the ServiceX storage will periodically get cleaned, so if you need to keep the results for long term use it is recommended that you download the output to local cache, but for transient use the URLs will be faster.

In general, if you are running on your laptop away from the ServiceX site and are working with a small amount of
data, select ``LocalCache`` for ``Delivery``. If you are located at an analysis facility, please select ``URLs``.

The Definitions Sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Definitions section (only available when setting up the request using YAML files) is a list of values that can be substituted into fields in the Sample
sections, defined using the YAML anchor/alias syntax. This is useful for defining common values that are used in multiple samples. This is an advanced concept.
