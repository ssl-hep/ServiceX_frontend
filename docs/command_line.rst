Command Line Interface (Experimental)
======================================
*\*The command line interface is an under-development feature that is not supported in the 3.0.0 release*

The command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with the ServiceX backend.
The client provides a new command in your shell,
``servicex``. This command uses a series of subcommands to work with
various functions of serviceX. It is installed automatically when you install the servicex frontend package.

Common command line arguments:

+-----+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| F   | Long     | What it does                                        |
| lag | Flag     |                                                     |
+=====+==========+=====================================================+
| -u  | –url     | The url of the serviceX ingress                     |
+-----+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| -b  | –backend | Named backend from the .servicex file endpoints     |
|     |          | list                                                |
+-----+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+

If neither url nor backend are specified then the client will attempt to
use the ``default_endpoint`` value to determine who to talk to.

codegens
~~~~~~~~

This command will list the code generators deployed.

transforms
~~~~~~~~~~

These commands interact with transforms that have been run

list
^^^^

List transforms associated with the current user. Add the ``--complete``
flag to only show transforms that have completed.

files
^^^^^

List the files along with their size generated by a transform. Specify
the transform request id with the ``-t`` or ``--transform-id`` flag

download
^^^^^^^^

Download the files from a transform to a local directory. Specify the
transform request id with ``-t`` and the directory to download to with
``-d``. Defaults to downloading files to the current working directory.

cache
~~~~~

These commands allow you to work with the query cache maintained by the
serviceX client.


list
^^^^

Show all of the cached transforms along with the run time, code
generator, and number of resulting files

delete
^^^^^^

Delete a specific transform from the cache. Provide the transform
request ID with the ``-t`` or ``--transform-id`` arg.

clear
^^^^^

Clear all of the transforms from the cache. Add ``-y`` to force the
operation without confirming with the console.

datasets
~~~~~~~~

These commands interact with datasets cached on the server

list
^^^^
List all of the datasets cached on the server. Accepts a command line argument
of ``--did-finder`` to filter the list of datasets by a specific DID finder such
as ``rucio`` or ``user``. By default this will filter out deleted datasets. They
are still in the cache, but marked as stale. To see deleted datasets, use the
``--show-deleted`` flag.

get
^^^
Get details about a specific dataset. Provide the dataset ID as a parameter. This
Will list the physical file paths found for each file in the dataset.

delete
^^^^^^
Delete a specific dataset from the cache. Provide the dataset ID as a parameter. This
will force the service to re-query the dataset for the next request.
