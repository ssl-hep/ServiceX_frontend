Command Line Interface
=======================

The command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with the system.
When installed, the client provides a new command in your shell,
``servicex``. This command uses a series of subcommands to work with
various functions of serviceX.

Common command line arguments:

+-----+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| F   | Long     | What it does                                        |
| lag | Flag     |                                                     |
+=====+==========+=====================================================+
| -u  | –url     | The url of the serviceX ingress                     |
+-----+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| -b  | –backend | Named backend from the .servicex file endpoints     |
|     |          | list                                                |
+-----+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+

If neither url nor backend are specified then the client will attempt to
use the ``default_endpoint`` value to determine who to talk to.

codegens
~~~~~~~~

This command will list the code generators deployed.

transforms
~~~~~~~~~~

These commands interact with transforms that have been run

list
^^^^

List transforms associated with the current user. Add the ``--complete``
flag to only show transforms that have completed.

files
^^^^^

List the files along with their size generated by a transform. Specify
the transform request id with the ``-t`` or ``--transform-id`` flag

download
^^^^^^^^

Download the files from a transform to a local directory. Specify the
transform request id with ``-t`` and the directory to download to with
``-d``. Defaults to downloading files to the current working directory.

cache
~~~~~

These commands allow you to work with the query cache maintained by the
serviceX client.

.. _list-1:

list
^^^^

Show all of the cached transforms along with the run time, code
generator, and number of resulting files

delete
^^^^^^

Delete a specific transform from the cache. Provide the transform
request ID with the ``-t`` or ``--transform-id`` arg.

clear
^^^^^

Clear all of the transforms from the cache. Add ``-y`` to force the
operation without confirming with the console.
