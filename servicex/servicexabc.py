    Abstract base class for accessing the ServiceX front-end for a particular dataset. This does

    A light weight, mostly immutable, base class that holds basic configuration information for use
    with ServiceX file access, including the dataset name. Subclasses implement the various access
    methods. Note that not all methods may be accessible!

        Create and configure a ServiceX object for a dataset.

        Arguments

            dataset                     Name of a dataset from which queries will be selected.
            image                       Name of transformer image to use to transform the data. If
                                        None the default implementation is used.
            cache_adaptor               Runs the caching for data and queries that are sent up and
                                        down.
            max_workers                 Maximum number of transformers to run simultaneously on
                                        ServiceX.
            result_destination          Where the transformers should write the results.
                                        Defaults to object-store, but could be used to save
                                        results to a posix volume
            cache_path                  Path to the cache
            status_callback_factory     Factory to create a status notification callback for each
                                        query. One is created per query.


        Notes:

            -  The `status_callback` argument, by default, uses the `tqdm` library to render
               progress bars in a terminal window or a graphic in a Jupyter notebook (with proper
               jupyter extensions installed). If `status_callback` is specified as None, no
               updates will be rendered. A custom callback function can also be specified which
               takes `(total_files, transformed, downloaded, skipped)` as an argument. The
               `total_files` parameter may be `None` until the system knows how many files need to
               be processed (and some files can even be completed before that is known).
